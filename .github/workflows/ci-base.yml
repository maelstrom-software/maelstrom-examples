# This is a [reusable
# workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows)
# for the Maelstrom examples repository.
#
# The way Maelstrom works it GitHub right now limits it to one cluster per
# workflow. To run jobs on different OSes, we need to create separate workflow
# instances. We do that by having separate workflows that just call this
# workflow, with the OS passed in as a parameter.
