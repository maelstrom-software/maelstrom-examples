This project is an example of using Maelstorm with a cargo package using
`cargo-maelstrom`.

This project is where most of the Rust examples live. There are two other
projects, [`cargo-workspace`](../cargo-workspace) and
[`../cargo-workspace-with-root-package`](../cargo-workspace-with-root-package).
Those just illustrate how to use [filter
patterns](https://maelstrom-software.com/doc/book/latest/cargo-maelstrom/filter.html)
to select packages in a workspace.

You will find the Rust examples in [`src/tests`](src/tests), and the
configuration settings that go with them in
[`cargo-maelstrom.toml`](cargo-maelstrom.toml).
