This project is an example of a cargo [virtual
workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html#virtual-workspace).

Filter patterns can use the `package`
[selector](https://maelstrom-software.com/doc/book/latest/cargo-maelstrom/filter.html#compound-selectors)
when necessary to distinguish between packages in the workspace.
